# Python
This repository includes some scripts where I practice / learn Python

# Components:

## CoreySchaferTutorials
This folder contains some of the work that I did while learning Python from CoreySchafer. This is a link to his YouTube channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCCezIgC97PvUuR4_gbFUs5g

**Note** that although much of the work here is based on the content he taught in his videos, I have added my own insight to the problems.
