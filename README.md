# Python

This repository includes some scripts where I practice / learn Python.
Most of my practice is done through projects, however here I include the things that don't quite 'fit' under projects. So this would include YouTube tutorials and Mini challenges that I set myself.

# Contents of repository:

## Mini_Challenges

This folder includes Python challenges that I've done in the past. The directory is further divided into:

**Cypher:** 3 cypher problems suggested to me by a friend

**DailyChallenges:** daily coding challenges

## CoreySchaferTutorials
This folder contains some of the work that I did while learning Python from CoreySchafer. This is a link to his YouTube channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCCezIgC97PvUuR4_gbFUs5g

It is mainly focused on OOP.

**Note** that although much of the work here is based on the content he taught in his videos, I have added my own insight to the problems.
