# Mini_challenges

This directory includes some of the mini-challenges that I have done to practise programming.

# Repository contents:

**Cypher:** a cypher challenge suggested to me by a friend (will add description)

**DailyChallenges:** a challenge that I set myself: "do a programming problem every single day". For each problem, I will provide a description (or a link to the problem).
