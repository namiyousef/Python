# Daily Challenges

Note: these are challenges that I've done as extra curricular projects. As such, it has been quite difficult to actually keep up with doing a new challenge every day. That said, I've made sure that I've done *some* coding every day, though this may not be reflected through my daily challenge files, but rather through my GitHub commits.
