# Daily Challenges

Note: these are challenges that I've done as extra curricular projects. As such, it has been quite difficult to actually keep up with doing a new challenge every day. That said, I've made sure that I've done *some* coding every day, though this may not be reflected through my daily challenge files, but rather through my GitHub commits.

# Challenge highlights:

Here I will highlight the challenges that I've done. I will try to split them into categories where possible.

## Leetcode Challenges

- **Day1.py:** given a list, *nums*, of numbers and a target sum, *target*, returns the indices of TWO numbers within *nums* that add up to *target*

- **Day2.py** given two numbers whose constituents (ones, tens, hundreds, etc...) are split in list form, *list1* and *list2*, returns the reverse of the sum of the two numbers in list form

- **Day4.py** given a string, *string*, returns the the longest substring

- **Day5.py** given two lists, *list1* and *list2*, finds the median when both are combined together

- **Day6.py** given a string, *s*, returns the longest palindromic substring

- **Day7.py** given a string, *s*, and a number of rows, *numRows*, maps the string into a zigzag format (based on number of rows) and returns the string when read row-wise

- **Day8.py** given an integer, *x*, returns the integer read backwards (sign remains the same)

- **Day9.py** given a string of numbers, *s*, returns the FIRST integer substring following whitespace as an integer. Returns 0 if integer substring preceded by non-whitespace characters (excluding + or -)

## Engineering Problems

- **Day3.py:** given the equation of motion of a multibody mechanical system in the form, M * X_ddot + C * X_dot + K * X = f, returns the equation in state-space form
